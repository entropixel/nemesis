Nemesis

This was entropixel's first project, started in June 2012 and was shelved shortly
after we finished the "jam" part of Dawning, in early November 2012. I'm uploading 
it in case anyone finds it interesting, there's not really any reason for me to 
keep it to myself forever.

It should compile on any sane setup with SDL2 installed. The Makefile is simple so
you can modify it if necessary.

The artwork is in this weird .nif format, which was supposed to make color 
shifting easier. If anyone wants the artwork in a different format, just contact 
me (tm512) and I'll see if I can find some converter for it.

I'm licensing the code under the ISC license, feel free to use it for pretty much
anything, if you want. Tempest, the artist, says the license on the art makes no
difference to him, so I'm releasing it under the CC BY license.
